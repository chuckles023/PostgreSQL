#Intro

This project serves as my intro to SQL where I explore a job postings data set and try to determine desireable jobs and what skills are required for those jobs.  This project will help me get comfortable with the syntax of SQL queries so that I can apply my analytical skills to datasets with an industry standard tool. For this project I will be using PostgreSQL as my database management system to get more acquainted with a commonly used form of SQL.  I will also be using VSCode to execute all queries as I already use it for anything I do in Python.  

# Analysis

With each query in this project, I want to analyze a specific aspect of the job market, targeting the Data Analyst role and looking for postings in Los Angeles, San Diego, and remote work.  

### Query 1: 

- In query 1, I took all job postings from my desired locations, organized the list by the average yearly salary and looked at the top 10.  This helps me understand what jobs on the market demand the highest salaries.  

### Query 2:

- In query 2, I looked at all data scientist job listings and ordered them by the average salary.  From this list I can see what companies are offering high paying jobs and what skills they value at those jobs.  

### Query 3:

- In query 3, I took value counts of the top 5 skills that showed up in job postings for Data Analyst positions.  This showed me which skills are valued by companies looking to hire data scientists.  

### Query 4:

- In query 4, I look at the top 25 skills, organized by the average salary of job postings with those skills listed.  From here I can identify financially rewarding skills and see what salaries are associated with higher pay.  

### Query 5:

- In query 5, I use my previous queries to identify the most optimal skills for obtaining a high paying data scientist role.  By looking at both the count and average salary of the skills at the same time I am able to determine which skills have high demand and are associated with high salaries.  

# Conclusions

The results of Query 5 show me that SQL, Excel, Python, Tableau, and R are the most important skills for data scientists.
